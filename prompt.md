GOAL: Integrate Stripe into my application for people to conduct a 1-off transaction for donating

You are orchestrating a multi-agent implementation of a Stripe one-time donation feature for an existing Vite + React / Supabase task manager application. The application already has authentication, RLS policies on existing tables, a Playwright MCP setup, and an Axios instance configured for API calls.

Execute the following three phases in order. Do not begin a new phase until the current phase's completion criteria are met.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ PHASE 1 — SUPABASE AGENT ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Spawn a sub-agent scoped exclusively to the Supabase layer. This agent must not touch any front-end files.

This agent is responsible for:

Creating a new Supabase Edge Function named process-donation that:

Accepts a POST request with body: { amount: number (in cents), user_id: string }
Validates that the user is authenticated and the amount is a positive integer greater than 0 and no greater than 1,000,000 (i.e. $10,000 max)
Uses STRIPE_SECRET_KEY from Supabase secrets (never hardcoded) to create a Stripe Payment Intent
Returns: { client_secret: string }
Creating a donations table in the Supabase database with this schema:

id: uuid, primary key, default gen_random_uuid()
user_id: uuid, foreign key referencing auth.users
amount: integer (cents)
stripe_payment_intent_id: text, unique
status: text ('succeeded' or 'failed')
created_at: timestamptz, default now()
Creating a Row Level Security policy on donations such that:

Users can only SELECT their own rows (user_id = auth.uid())
No user can INSERT directly — inserts come only from the webhook handler
Service role can INSERT and UPDATE
Creating a new Supabase Edge Function named stripe-webhook that:

Listens for POST requests from Stripe
Validates the Stripe webhook signature using STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET from Supabase secrets
Handles payment_intent.succeeded: checks if stripe_payment_intent_id already exists in donations (idempotency), and if not, inserts a row with status='succeeded'
Handles payment_intent.payment_failed: same idempotency check, inserts with status='failed'
Returns 200 for all handled events, 400 for signature failures
Phase 1 is complete when:

Both Edge Functions exist and are deployable without errors
The donations table exists with the correct schema
RLS policies are in place and correct
No Stripe secret key appears in any committed file
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ PHASE 2 — UI AGENT ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Spawn a sub-agent scoped exclusively to the React + Vite front end. This agent must not touch any Supabase files, Edge Functions, or database migrations.

This agent is responsible for:

1. Creating a new React page component at the route /donate that:

    - Is registered in the existing React Router DOM setup
    - can be accessed by clicking on on icon pinned to the lower of the application page. Please utilize @./help_fight_hunger.png for reference
    - Displays a heading and brief description of the donation feature
    - Includes amount options (suggested: $5, $10, $25, $50) plus a custom amount input
    - Embeds a Stripe Elements card input (CardElement) using @stripe/react-stripe-js
    - Has a "Donate" submit button

2. Implementing the payment flow in the donate page:

    - On submit, use the existing Axios instance to POST to the process-donation Edge Function with: { amount: selectedAmountInCents, user_id: currentUser.id }
    - The current user's id is available from the existing auth context
    - On receiving { client_secret }, use Stripe.js (stripe.confirmCardPayment) — NOT Axios — to confirm the Payment Intent directly with Stripe
    - Do not use Axios for the payment confirmation step

3. Rendering clear result states:

    - On success: display a thank-you message that includes the donation amount
    - On failure: display a user-friendly error message (no raw Stripe error codes or stack traces visible to the user)
    - On network error (Edge Function unreachable): display a generic "something went wrong" message and a retry option

4. Running Playwright verification after completing the UI. Use the existing Playwright MCP setup to:

    - Navigate to /donate and confirm the page renders with the expected heading
    - Confirm the Stripe Elements iframe is present in the DOM
    - Select the $10 amount option
    - Complete the card input using Stripe test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242, any future expiry, any CVC
    - Submit and confirm the success state renders
    - Reset and use decline card: 4000 0000 0000 0002
    - Submit and confirm the error state renders with a human-readable message

Phase 2 is complete when:

- The /donate route renders without errors
- The Stripe Elements card input is present and functional
- The Axios call targets the correct Edge Function endpoint
- Stripe.js (not Axios) is used for payment confirmation
- All Playwright verification steps pass

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ PHASE 3 — SUPERVISOR AGENT ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Spawn a sub-agent with read access to all files produced by Phase 1 and Phase 2. This agent must not write new feature code. It may only correct specific failures it identifies and document its findings.

This agent must first define its own passing requirements — before reviewing any code — based on what a correct, secure, production-ready Stripe one-time payment integration looks like. Document these requirements as a numbered list before proceeding.

Then review the output of both agents against those requirements, with explicit focus on:

1. API contract alignment: does the UI's Axios call body match exactly what the process-donation Edge Function expects? Does it correctly consume { client_secret } from the response?

2. Payment confirmation method: is stripe.confirmCardPayment (Stripe.js) being used for the confirmation step — not a second Axios call?

3. Webhook registration: is the stripe-webhook Edge Function URL the one that should be registered in the Stripe dashboard? Document the exact URL.

4. Idempotency: does the webhook handler check for an existing stripe_payment_intent_id before inserting?

5. RLS correctness: can a user read another user's donation rows? Verify the policy logic.

6. Security gate — CRITICAL: scan all front-end files for any occurrence of STRIPE*SECRET_KEY or any string beginning with sk*. If found anywhere in front-end code or committed environment files, this is a hard failure. Report it immediately and halt.

After all checks pass, run the full Playwright suite one final time as an end-to-end integration verification.

Phase 3 output must include:

- The supervisor's self-defined passing requirements (numbered list)
- A pass/fail result for each check above
- The webhook URL to register in the Stripe dashboard
- The Playwright suite result (pass or specific failures)
- If any check failed: which agent is responsible and the exact correction needed
- Phase 3 is complete when all checks pass and the final Playwright run succeeds.

Be advised the STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY and STRIPE_SECRET_KEY have already been added to this project within a .env file and should only referenced by environment variables and never hard coded.
